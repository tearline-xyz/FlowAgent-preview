## Features

### LP pledge arbitrage

Users leverage AI to analyze yield differences across identical liquidity pools on various DEXs and automatically migrate their positions to the most profitable option.

- Scan APY/Gas/Impermanent Loss data of multiple DEXs in real time.
- Batch processing of migration transactions.
- Pre-calculate the balance point between hedging costs and benefits.

### Revolving loan

Users pledge assets to borrow stablecoins, while AI dynamically optimizes the collateral ratio and allocates funds to high-yield farming pools to generate leveraged returns.

- Collateral rate dynamic model (based on price volatility).
- Interest rate differential comparison engine (borrowing cost vs mining income).
- Cross-chain Gas Optimization.

### Cross-DEX Arbitrage

The system captures price discrepancies of the same asset across DEXs on different chains and executes risk-free arbitrage using MEV-protected strategies.

- Spread Threshold Discovery.
- Transaction splitting + Flashbots privacy protection.
- Slippage Circuit Breaker.
- Increased revenue.

## Technical Highlights

### AI-Driven Decision Making

AI algorithms analyze real-time data to make informed decisions, optimizing yield and minimizing risks.

### Cross-Chain Compatibility

Supports multiple chains, allowing users to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities across different ecosystems.

### MCP based

Based on the MCP (Monitor-Compute-Prove) architecture and the concept of user sovereignty first, we create the most transparent and secure AI strategy execution engine in the DeFi field.
